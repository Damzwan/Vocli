## 🚀 Why?

I'm learning a language myself and wanted a lightweight tool to save the vocabulary I am struggling with.  
I often note words down while, for example, talking — but I don’t want to manually insert all the words or search for translations.  
Vocli solves this for me, and hopefully for you too!
